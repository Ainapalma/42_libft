# 42_libft

Libft is a project that requires us to re-create some standard C library functions including some additional ones that can be used later during the program.

The goal is to us have a deeper understanding of data structures and basic algorithms.

`libft.subject.pdf` is the task file.

Run `make` so you can build the library.

Check by running [libft-unit-test](https://github.com/alelievr/libft-unit-test).
